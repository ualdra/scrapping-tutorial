# Learn Web Scrapping as fast as we can
In the tutorial we are going to try to learn webscrapping as fast as we can. We are going to learn the difference between simple web scrapping and more advanced ones.

* For the **simple** web scrapping we are going to scrapp [Real Federación española de Fútbol](https://www.rfef.es/clasificacion-historica) to get the information of the historic clasification the 1st division of the Spanish Soccer league (la liga) through the years.
* For a more **advanced** scrapping we are going to try to get information about the subjects in the [Computer Engineering](https://www.ual.es/estudios/grados/presentacion/plandeestudios/4015?idioma=es_ES) degree in the University of Almería.


## Node.js
In the folder node we can find both tutorials made with node.js language. In the case of the simple one we use [cheerio.js](https://cheerio.js.org) to analize the classification. In the advanced tutorial we use [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev).
